#### Task1 : Question # 2
#Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple
#of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a
#comma-separated sequence on a single line.

#Solution_1
#----------
result = ''
for i in range(2000,3201):
    if (i%7 == 0) and (i%5 != 0):
        result += str(i)+","
print(result)

#Solution_2
#----------
result = ''
for i in range(2000,3201):
    if (i%7 == 0) and (i%5 != 0):
        if result == '':
            result = str(i)
        else:
            result += ","+str(i)
print(result)

#Solution_3
#----------
result = []
for i in range(2000,3201):
    if (i%7 == 0) and (i%5 != 0):
        result.append(i)

for j in result:
    print(str(j)+",", end="")
    
#### Task1 : Question # 3
#Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in
#the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.

#Solution
#--------
fname = input('Please enter your first name: ')
lname = input('Please enter your last name: ')
print(lname[::-1]+' '+fname[::-1])

#### Task1 : Question # 4
#Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
#Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r 3

import math
d = 12
V = 4/3 * math.pi * (d/2)**3
print(V)

#### Task2 : Question # 1
#Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and
#generate a list.

#Solution
#--------
num = input('Enter comma separated numbers: ')
result = num.split(',')
print(result)

#### Task2 : Question # 2
#Create the below pattern using nested for loop in Python.

#Solution
#--------
for i in range(2,11): # 9 lines
    if i <= 6: # increasing
        for y in range(1,i):
            print('*', end="")
    elif i <= 11: # decreasing
        for y in range(1,12-i):
            print('*', end="")
    print()
    
#### Task2 : Question # 3
#Write a Python program to reverse a word after accepting the input from the user.
  
#Solution
#--------
i = input('Please enter a string: ')
print(i[::-1])
